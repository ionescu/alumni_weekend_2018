/Abstract/: Our lives are increasingly influenced by software systems that no single person can fully understand; from machine-learning frameworks "in the cloud", to models of climate change or financial risks, to self-driving cars.  The challenge of ensuring the correctness of these systems led to the foundations of the social sciences.


*Plan*

- Context
  - PIK
  - Simulation as a third way of doing science
  - Specifications and program correctness
  - Specifications as theories
- Example of vulnerability
  - vulnerability to climate change
  - definitions
  - "vulnerability to cause" versus "vulnerability to harm"
- Modeling vulnerability
  - A mathematical model
  - measures of vulnerability: anything goes?
  - monotonicity condition, examples of falsification
  - if there is time, "cause" vs "harm"
- Related work
  - other work: resilience, avoidability
  - essential tool: monadic dynamical system
- Conclusions
  - the role of mathematics in social science
    - previous examples: Andre Weil, Joseph Goguen, ...
    - descriptive, not (primarily) predictive
      - extension of analytic philosophy to mathematics
    - algebraic vs analytic
  - future
    - systematically explore software models and reverse engineer specifications
    - next stop: migration waves
